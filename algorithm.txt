1. Import libraries for image processing, machine learning, and augmentation.
2. Define the `augment_image` function to apply augmentations.
3. Define feature extraction functions:
   a. GLCM features
   b. Intensity features
   c. LBP features
4. Define functions to process normal and NIfTI images:
   a. Apply augmentation, dark filter, Gaussian blur, K-Means clustering, and histogram equalization.
   b. Extract features (GLCM, intensity, LBP).
5. Define `process_folder` function to load images from folders and extract features.
6. Define `reduce_features` to apply PCA and reduce the dimensionality.
7. Define `apply_svm_with_tuning` to perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for SVM.
8. Main Function Workflow:
   a. Load images and extract features.
   b. Split the data into training and test sets.
   c. Impute missing values and standardize the features.
   d. Reduce feature dimensions using PCA.
   e. Apply SVM with hyperparameter tuning and train the model.
   f. Evaluate the model on the test set.
9. Configure GPU memory growth if available for TensorFlow.
10. Execute the `main` function if the script is run directly.
